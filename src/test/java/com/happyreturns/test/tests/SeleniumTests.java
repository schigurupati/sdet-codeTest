/**
 *  CHALLENGE :
 *  For our challenge, we need to create a Selenium test that navigates to Google.com
 *  and performs a search for "Happy Returns".
 *
 *  After the results are displayed, assert that The Happy Returns site with address www.happyreturns.com is the first organic result
 *  returned. We are NOT looking for the ad that is returned, but the first organic result.
 *
 *  Notes : Feel free to create classes, rename this class, approach this challenge however you'd like.
 *  Keep it simple or get fancy with it if you have time.
 *
 *  Time: 30 minutes
